# Bug Blaster: Agile Issue Management Platform

## Project Overview

**Bug Blaster** is a modern, streamlined platform designed to help development teams efficiently log, prioritize, and resolve software defects (bugs) and track feature requests. It provides a clean, intuitive interface to manage the full issue lifecycle, from initial report to final deployment.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate best practices in full-stack development, specifically focusing on data modeling, secure authentication, and a responsive user experience.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Agile Board View:** Visualize issues in Kanban-style columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Under Review, Done).
* **Detailed Issue Tracking:** Log bugs with comprehensive details, including severity, priority, environment, and reproduction steps.
* **User Assignment & Collaboration:** Assign issues to specific team members and track who is working on what.
* **Status & Priority Tags:** Quickly filter and sort issues based on customizable status labels and priority levels.
* **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system with role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Developer, Reporter).
* **Search and Filtering:** Robust tools to quickly find issues based on keywords, users, or tags.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rayancmorais/bugBlaster.git](https://github.com/rayancmorais/bugBlaster.git)
    cd bugBlaster
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the server directory** (Assuming a common structure):
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    JWT_SECRET="a_long_secret_key"
    ```

4.  **Run the Backend:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # The server should now be running at http://localhost:5000
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the client directory** (Assuming a common structure):
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
